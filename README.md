# Sajal's Social Network API Project

## Description

I added all the api routes for the users and some api routes for the thoughts.

I finished adding all the api routes for the thoughts and reactions as well as the users and friends.

## Installation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then downloaded the starter folders through git bash.

## Usage
Users can be created, updated, deleted, found by Id, or viewed in a list of other users. Users can also add and delete friends from their list.

Thoughts can also be created, updated, deleted, found by Id, or viewed in a list of other thoughts. Reactions can also added to a thought or deleted from one.

## License
None

## Test
Enter nodemon in the command prompt. User should then be able to perform all the actions listed in the usage section.

## Demo 
Here is a two part walkthrough of the application:
